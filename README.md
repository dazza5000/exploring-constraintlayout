ConstraintLayout Notes:

A ConstraintLayout is a ViewGroup which allows you to position and size widgets in a flexible way.

ConstraintLayout is available as a support library that you can use on Android systems starting with API level 9 (Gingerbread). As such, we are planning on enriching its API and capabilities over time. This documentation will reflect those changes. 

There are currently various types of constraints that you can use:
Relative positioning
Margins
Centering positioning
Circular positioning
Visibility behavior
Dimension constraints
Chains
Virtual Helpers objects
Optimizer

Note that you cannot have a circular dependency in constraints.
